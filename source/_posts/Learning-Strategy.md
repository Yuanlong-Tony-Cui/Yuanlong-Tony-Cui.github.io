1. 切忌本末倒置
   Understand how a theorem or method is applied (what it is used for and what each parameter means in a formula) prior to understanding how it is derived.
   Reasoning (i.e. knowing the procedures behind it) should only be a way to help you to better use the theorem or method, otherwise it will be too time-consuming and mislead you away from the true essence of engineering.

2. 不可纸上谈兵
   Start solving problems once you know the basics of a concept.
   This is when you applied the concept and start to see different scenarios, which is very close to the real situations you will encounter in your future career.

3. 归纳总结与融会贯通
   Keep summarizing and connecting all your knowledge to build enormous network.
   These two ways help you learn new knowledge faster, just like the mechanism of machine learning - the more knowledge it intakes, the smarter the AI would be.
